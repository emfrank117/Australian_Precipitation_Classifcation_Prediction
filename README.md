# Precipitation Predicion in Australia

### Project Overview and Objectives <br>

Planning for the day involves many factors, and one of the most significant is the weather, specifically, whether it will rain. Rain can impact a variety of daily decisions, and while rainy days are unavoidable, the ability to more accurately predict if it will rain tomorrow can make a significant difference. The question becomes: will it rain, and do you need an umbrella? <br>

The main source of weather planning is the local weather stations by TV, radio, or print, with a general accuracy of 80-90% for short term forecasts. This raises the question, is their accuracy based more on knowledge and understanding of the weather patterns or historical data and modeling. Could individuals, without formal meteorological training, be nearly as effective by relying on historical data alone? Let’s explore the historical weather data from the Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology utilizing the 49 weather stations across the country, with the aim to understand Australia’s weather patterns and develop a precipitation prediction model that answers the question: will it rain tomorrow, yes, or no? <br>

This project follows the traditional approach to building a predictive model for rainfall in Australia. It begins with data preprocessing and cleaning, preparing the dataset for extensive exploratory data analysis and visualization, where insights, patterns, and trends are identified. Next, a variety of models are developed, considering the strengths and weaknesses of the data. The models are then evaluated and compared, with the goal of identifying the most accurate and reliable models for predicting rainy days. <br>

### Prediction Goals <br>
